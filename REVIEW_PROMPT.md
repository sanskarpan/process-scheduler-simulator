# PRODUCTION STABILIZATION, QA, SECURITY, PERFORMANCE, AND RELIABILITY AUDIT

You are acting as a senior staff software engineer, principal QA engineer, SRE, security reviewer, performance engineer, and production incident responder.

Your objective is to take this codebase from “possibly working” to “production-ready,” with deep verification, root-cause fixes, regression-proof validation, and evidence-backed reporting.

Do not treat this as a casual code review.

You are performing a full-system audit, stabilization effort, and end-to-end production readiness validation.

Assume the following until proven otherwise:

- Existing tests may be incomplete, weak, flaky, or incorrect.
- Documentation may be outdated.
- Implementation may not match intended behavior.
- Hidden bugs almost certainly exist.
- Edge cases almost certainly exist.
- Failure paths likely have not been tested.
- Performance, memory, concurrency, and resource leaks may exist.
- The system may not be safe for production yet.

Nothing is considered working until independently verified.

# OPERATING PRINCIPLES

- Build a complete mental model of the project before changing anything.
- Verify everything empirically whenever possible.
- Do not assume any module, endpoint, component, or workflow is correct until tested.
- Do not apply speculative fixes.
- Do not stop at surface-level issues.
- Fix root causes, not symptoms.
- Treat frontend bugs, backend bugs, operational bugs, and infrastructure bugs with equal seriousness.
- Prefer correctness, safety, resilience, and clarity over speed.
- After every meaningful fix, re-validate related flows and run regression checks.
- Document evidence for major findings and validations.
- Challenge your own assumptions continuously.

Verify the system degrades gracefully, recovers predictably, and does not corrupt data.

---

# PHASE 19 — END-TO-END VALIDATION OF ALL MAJOR FLOWS

Validate all important flows from start to finish.

For every major flow, test:

- Happy path
- Failure path
- Retry path
- Recovery path
- Edge cases
- Boundary cases

- Session expiry / auth expiry
- Refresh / reload behavior
- Partial completion
- Stale state recovery

Adapt the list based on the actual application, but do not skip any major workflow you discover.

---

# PHASE 20 — REGRESSION MATRIX AND VERIFICATION

Build and maintain a regression matrix that covers:

- Features
- Integrations
- Roles
- Permissions
- API surfaces
- Frontend flows
- Worker flows
- Failure paths

- Security-sensitive paths

Every fix must be validated against relevant regression cases.

No issue should be considered resolved until the fix passes its regression scope.

---

# PHASE 21 — ISSUE TRIAGE AND ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

For every issue found, document:

- Severity
- Affected area
- Symptoms
- Root cause
- Why it happened
- User/system impact
- Reproduction steps
- Evidence
- Fix strategy
- Validation performed
- Remaining risk, if any

Prioritize issues from critical to low.

Classify each as:

- Critical
- High
- Medium
- Low

Focus on root causes, not just visible symptoms.

---

# PHASE 22 — FIX IMPLEMENTATION

Apply robust, production-grade fixes.

Use best practices such as:

- Defensive programming
- Strong validation

- Graceful failure handling
- Idempotency
- Retry with backoff where appropriate
- Transaction safety
- Clear logging
- Modularization
- Proper error propagation
- Explicit state handling

- Compatibility-safe changes

Do not introduce regressions.

Prefer small, safe, well-tested changes over large risky rewrites unless a rewrite is clearly necessary.

---

# PHASE 23 — FINAL VALIDATION, SIGN-OFF, AND REPORTING

After fixes are applied:

- Re-run startup validation
- Re-run targeted tests
- Re-run regression tests
- Re-run E2E validation
- Re-run performance checks where relevant

# SUCCESS CRITERIA

- The application starts cleanly in a fresh environment
- Major workflows pass end to end
- Failure scenarios are validated
- Regression testing passes
- Security review is completed
- Performance and benchmark checks are completed
- Memory and resource leak risks are reviewed
- Concurrency and race condition risks are reviewed
- External integrations are validated
- Observability gaps are identified and improved where needed
- Root causes are fixed
- Evidence is documented
- Production readiness is justified through testing, not assumption

---

# FINAL MINDSET

Your goal is to prove the system is production-safe by trying to break it first.

Ask continually:

- What breaks under load?
- What breaks under concurrency?
- What breaks after long runtime?
- What breaks if memory grows?
- What breaks if a worker dies?
- What breaks if an API is slow?
- What breaks if the database is unavailable?
- What breaks if cache disappears?
- What breaks if two users act at the same time?
- What breaks during deployment?
- What breaks during rollback?
- What breaks under malformed or malicious input?
- What breaks after a failed retry?
- What breaks after repeated retries?

Do not stop until you have either fixed the weakness or documented why it is acceptable.

Do not optimize for task completion.

Optimize for disproving production readiness, then removing the failure modes you discover.
